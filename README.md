# Differences from other implementations
- Official: [grammarly/gector](https://github.com/grammarly/gector)
    - Without AllenNLP
    - Trained checkpoints can be downloaded from Hub
    - Distributed training
    - ðŸ˜” Does not support probabilistic ensemble
- [cofe-ai/fast-gector](https://github.com/cofe-ai/fast-gector)
    - Use Accelerate for distributed training

# Installing
Confirmed that it works on python3.8.10.
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Donwload the verb dictionary in advance
mkdir data
cd data
wget https://github.com/grammarly/gector/raw/master/data/verb-form-vocab.txt
```

# Usage
I will published pre-trained weights on Hugging Face Hub. Please refer to [Performance can be obtained](https://github.com/gotutiyan/gector#performance_can_be_obtained).

CLI
```sh
python predict.py \
    --input <raw text file> \
    --restore_dir gotutiyan/gector-roberta-base-5k \
    --out <path to output file>
```

API
```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from gector.modeling import GECToR
from gector.predict import predict, load_verb_dict

model_id = 'gotutiyan/gector-roberta-base-5k'
model = GECToR.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
encode, decode = load_verb_dict('data/verb-form-vocab.txt')
srcs = [
    'This is a correct sentence.',
    'This are a wrong sentences'
]
corrected = predict(
    model, tokenizer, srcs,
    encode, decode,
    keep_confidence=0.0,
    min_error_prob=0.0,
    n_iteration=5,
    batch_size=2,
)
print(corrected)
```

- This implementation does not support probabilistic ensemble inference. Please use majority voting ensemble [[Tarnavskyi+ 2022]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.266/) instead.
```sh
wget https://github.com/MaksTarnavskyi/gector-large/raw/master/ensemble.py
python ensemble.py \
    --source_file <source> \
    --target_files <hyp1> <hyp2> ... \
    --output_file <out>
```

# Performances obtained

I performed experiments using this implementation. Trained models are also obtained from Hugging Face Hub.
- All models below are trained on all of stages 1, 2, and 3 (10 epochs each). 
    - Note that the number of epochs for stage1 is smaller than official setting (= 20 epochs). The reasons for this were (1) the results were competitive the results in the paper even at 10 epochs, and (2) I did not want to occupy as much computational resources in my laboratory as possible.
- The tag vocabulary is the same as [official one](https://github.com/grammarly/gector/blob/master/data/output_vocabulary/labels.txt).
- I trained on three different seeds (10,11,12) for each model, and use the one with the best performance.
    - Futhermore, I tweaked a keep confidence and a sentence-level minimum error probability threshold (from 0 to 0.9, 0.1 steps each) for each best model. 
    - Finally, the checkpoint with the highest F0.5 on BEA-dev is used. 
    - The number of iterations is 5.
- Used ERRANT for the BEA-dev evaluation.
- Used [CodaLab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/4057) for the BEA-test evaluation.
- Used M2 Scorer for the CoNLL14 evaluation.

### Single setting

- "Training time" is the total time for stages 1, 2, and 3 (including preprocessing) when two RTX 3090s are used.

# How to train
### Preprocess
Use official preprocessing code.
E.g.
```sh
mkdir utils
cd utils
wget https://github.com/grammarly/gector/raw/master/utils/preprocess_data.py
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grammarly/gector/master/utils/helpers.py
cd ..
python utils/preprocess_data.py \
    -s <raw source file path> \
    -t <raw target file path> \
    -o <output path>
```

### Train
`train.py` uses Accelerate. Please input your environment with `accelerate config` in advance.
```sh
accelerate launch train.py \
    --train_file <preprocess output of train> \
    --valid_file <preprocess output of validation> \
    --save_dir outputs/sample
```

NOTE: For those who are familiar with the [official implementation](https://github.com/grammarly/gector/tree/master),
- `--tag_strategy` is not available but it is forced to keep_one.
- `--skip_correct` is not available. Please remove identical pairs from your training data in advance.
- `--patience` is not available since this implementation does not employ early stopping.
- `--special_token_fix` is not available since this code automatically judge this one from `--model_id`.

The best and last checkpoints are saved. The format is:
```

```

# Inference

The same usage of the [Usage](https://github.com/gotutiyan/gector#usage). You can specify `best/` or `last/` directory to `--restore_dir`.

CLI
```sh
python predict.py \
    --input <raw text file> \
    --restore_dir outputs/sample/best \
    --out <path to output file>
```
<details>
<summary>Other options of predict.py: </summary>

|Option|Default|Note|
|:--|:--|:--|
|--n_iteration|5|The number of iterations.|
|--batch_size|128||
|--keep_confidence|0.0|A bias for the $KEEP label.|
|--min_error_prob|0.0|A sentence-level minimum error
probability threshold|
|--verb_file|`data/verb-form-vocab.txt`|Assume that you already have this file by [Installing]((https://github.com/gotutiyan/gector#installing)).|

</details>

Or, to use as API,
```py
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from gector.modeling import GECToR

path = 'outputs/sample/best'
model = GECToR.from_pretrained(path)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(path)
```

### Tweak parameters
To tweak two parameters in the inference, please use `predict_tweak.py`.  
The following example tweaks both of parameters in `{0, 0.1, 0.2 ... 0.9}`. `kc` is a keep confidence and `mep` is a minimum error probability threshold.
```sh
python predict.py \
    --input <raw text file> \
    --restore_dir outputs/sample/best \
    --kc_min 0 \
    --kc_max 1 \
    --mep_min 0 \
    --mep_max 1 \
    --step 0.1
```

This script creates `<--restore_dir>/outputs/tweak_outputs/` and saves each output in it.
```
models/sample/best/outputs/tweak_outputs/
â”œâ”€â”€ kc0.0_mep0.0.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ kc0.0_mep0.1.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ kc0.0_mep0.2.txt
...
```

After that, you can determine the best parameters by doing the following:
```sh
RESTORE_DIR=${1}
for kc in `seq 0 0.1 0.9` ; do
for mep in `seq 0 0.1 0.9` ; do
# Refer to $RESTORE_DIR/outputs/tweak_output/kc${kc}_mep${mep}.txt in the evaluation scripts
done
done
```
